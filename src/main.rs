Interactive terminal explorer for model checkpoints — .safetensors, .gguf, .npy/.npz, \
and (with the hdf5 build) .hdf5.

Beyond the tree of tensor names and shapes, it shows the actual data: ASCII heatmaps, \
numeric-value grids, value histograms, and exact whole-tensor statistics — streamed in \
bounded blocks, so multi-GB tensors work without loading them into RAM. Packed / \
quantized weights (4-bit, fused-codebook MoE) are decoded to their true values. \
Sharded / multi-file models, directories, and globs merge into one tree.

Remote checkpoints are read over SSH — a safetensors directory/file via SFTP, or an \
s3:// cstorch checkpoint via a remote venv — sending only metadata off the host, so \
data and credentials stay remote. For scripts and agents there are one-shot \
--print-tree / --print-tensors exports (text or JSON) and a `diff` subcommand with \
diff-style exit codes.
